## Conclusion

***
* The model prediction scores 74%. Meaning 74% of the inputs successfully predicted by the model.
* There are several features that have significant impact on productivity, which are:
** Reason 1 - 4
** Transportation expenses
** Children
** Body Mass Index
* Reason number 3 plays a big role for the absenteeism hours of an employee. Follows by reason number 1. This is considered logical, since reason number 3 related to poisoning and reason number 1 related to various disease.
